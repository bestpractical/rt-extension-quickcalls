RT-Extension-QuickCalls 

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
    add RT::Extension::QuickCalls to your @Plugins line in RT_SiteConfig.pm

You will need to enable the new QuickCalls portlet with a line
like this in your RT_SiteConfig.pm file

Set($HomepageComponents, [qw(QuickCreate Quicksearch MyAdminQueues MySupportQueues MyReminders
                             RefreshHomepage QuickCalls)]);

This is the default portlet list with QuickCalls added to the end
People can then choose to add the portlet to their homepage
in Preferences -> RT at a glance

To set up your Quick Calls, you will want to specify a Name and a Queue
in the config file.  The Name will become the Subject of the task unless
you specify a Subject option.  You can add other Ticket options as needed,
such as Status.  You can also add SetOwnerToCurrentUser if you want to default 
the Owner to the current user.

Set($QuickCalls,[{Name => "Foo", Queue => 'General', Status => 'resolved'},
                 {Name => "Bar", Queue => 'Queue2',  Status => 'resolved'}]);

After you have added QuickCalls to your home page, you will be able to select
one, click Create and be brought to the ticket creation page with multiple
fields pre-filled
