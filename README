NAME
    RT::Extension::QuickCalls - Quickly create tickets in specific queues
    with default values

SYNOPSIS
    You will need to enable the new QuickCalls portlet with a line like this
    in your RT_SiteConfig.pm file

        Set($HomepageComponents, [qw(QuickCreate Quicksearch MyAdminQueues MySupportQueues MyReminders
                                     RefreshHomepage QuickCalls)]);

    This is the default portlet list with QuickCalls added to the end People
    can then choose to add the portlet to their homepage in Preferences ->
    RT at a glance

    To set up your Quick Calls, you will want to specify a Name and a Queue
    in the config file. The Name will become the Subject of the task unless
    you specify a Subject option. You can add other Ticket options as
    needed, such as Status.

        Set($QuickCalls,[{Name => "Foo", Queue => 'General', Status => 'resolved'},
                         {Name => "Bar", Queue => 'Queue2',  Status => 'resolved'}]);

    After you have added QuickCalls to your home page, you will be able to
    select one, click Create and be brought to the ticket creation page with
    multiple fields pre-filled
