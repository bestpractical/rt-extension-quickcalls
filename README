NAME
    RT::Extension::QuickCalls - Quickly create tickets in specific queues
    with default values

SYNOPSIS
    You will need to enable the new QuickCalls portlet with a line like this
    in your RT_SiteConfig.pm file:

        Set($HomepageComponents, [qw(QuickCreate Quicksearch MyAdminQueues MySupportQueues MyReminders
                                     RefreshHomepage QuickCalls)]);

    This is the default portlet list with QuickCalls added to the end People
    can then choose to add the portlet to their homepage in Preferences ->
    RT at a glance

    To set up your Quick Calls, you will want to specify a Name and a Queue
    in the config file. The Name will become the Subject of the task unless
    you specify a Subject option. You can add other Ticket options as
    needed, such as Status. Additionally, if the SetOwnerToCurrentUser
    option is set, the ticket will be owned by the current user.

        Set($QuickCalls,[{Name => "Foo", Queue => 'General', Status => 'resolved'},
                         {Name => "Bar", Queue => 'Queue2',  Status => 'resolved'}]);

    If a value is an anonymous subref, it will be called when the QuickCall
    is selected, and its return value filled in for the appropriate key:

        Set($QuickCalls,[ {
           Queue   => 'General',
           Name    => 'This will have the current time on the server in its content',
           Content => sub {
              my $date = localtime;
              return "When: $date\n\n";
           },
        }]);

    After you have added QuickCalls to your home page, you will be able to
    select one, click Create and be brought to the ticket creation page with
    multiple fields pre-filled.
